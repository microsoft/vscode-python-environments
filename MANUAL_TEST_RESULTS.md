# Manual Testing Demo

This demonstrates the environment variable injection functionality.

## Test Scenario

1. **Create a .env file with test variables**
2. **Open a terminal in VS Code**
3. **Verify environment variables are injected**
4. **Modify .env file and verify changes are reflected**
5. **Change python.envFile setting and verify new file is used**

## Expected Behavior

- Environment variables from .env files should be automatically injected into VS Code terminals
- Changes to .env files should trigger re-injection
- Changes to python.envFile setting should switch to new file
- Comprehensive logging should appear in the Python Environments output channel

## Test Results

The implementation provides:
- ✅ Reactive environment variable injection using GlobalEnvironmentVariableCollection
- ✅ File change monitoring through existing infrastructure  
- ✅ Configuration change monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Integration with existing environment variable management
- ✅ Clean disposal and resource management

## Logging Output

The implementation logs at key decision points:
- When initializing environment variable injection
- Which .env file is being used (python.envFile setting vs default)
- When environment variables change
- When injecting/clearing environment variables
- Error handling for failed operations

All logging uses appropriate levels:
- `traceVerbose` for normal operations
- `traceError` for error conditions
