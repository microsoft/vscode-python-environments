### Template example for Environment Manager

This is a template for an environment manager extension. It demonstrates how to use the Python Environments API to register your custom environment manager. You can look at implementations for `venv`, and `conda` (here https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/blob/main/src/managers) for more examples.
