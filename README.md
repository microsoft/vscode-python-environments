# Python Environments and Package Manager (preview)

## Overview

Python Environments and Package Manager is a VS Code extension that helps users manage their Python environments and packages with their preferred environment manager using extensible APIs. This extension provides unique support to specify environments for specific files, whole Python projects, or multiroot/monorepos scenarios.

> Note: This extension is in preview and the APIs and features are subject to change as the project evolves.

## Features

### Environment Management

This extension provides an environment view in the Activity Bar for the user to manage their Python environments. The user can create, delete, and switch between environments as desired. The user can also install and uninstall packages in the current environment. This extension provides APIs for extension developers to contribute environment managers.

The default environment manager is the environment manager that the extension uses automatically, unless you specify otherwise. It determines how environments are created, managed, and where the packages are installed. The extension by uses `venv` by default, however you can change this by setting the `python-envs.defaultEnvManager` setting to a different environment manager. The following are environment managers that are supported out of the box:

|Id| name |Description|
|---|----|--|
|ms-python.python:venv| `venv` |The default environment manager. It is a built-in environment manager provided by the Python standard library.|
|ms-python.python:system| System Installed Python | These are python installs on your system. Installed either with your OS, or from python.org, or any other OS package manager |
|ms-python.python:conda| `conda` |The conda environment manager. It is a popular environment manager for Python.|

The environment manager is responsible for specifying which package manager will be used by default to install and manage Python packages within the environment. This ensures that packages are managed consistently according to the preferred tools and settings of the chosen environment manager.

### Package Management

This extension provides a package view for the user to manage, install and uninstall, their Python packages in any partiular environment. This extension provides APIs for extension developers to contribute package managers.

The extension by uses `pip` as the default package manager. You can change this by setting the `python-envs.defaultPackageManager` setting to a different package manager. Following are the out of the box package managers:

|Id| name |Description|
|---|----|--|
|ms-python.python:pip| `pip` | Pip acts as the default package manager and is built-in to the Python language provided by the Python standard library.|
|ms-python.python:conda| `conda` |The conda package manager. |

## Settings Reference

The extension recognizes and consumes a variety of settings from the Python extension and third-party providers to allow more control over your desired experience. 

| Setting (python-envs.) |	Default |	Description |
| ----- | ----- | -----| 
| defaultEnvManager | `"ms-python.python:venv"` |	The default environment manager used for creating and managing environments. |
| defaultPackageManager | `"ms-python.python:pip"` |	The default package manager to use for installing and managing packages. This is often dictated by the default environment manager but can be customized. |
| pythonProjects | `[]` |	A list of Python workspaces, specified by the path, in which you can set particular environment and package managers. You can set information for a workspace as `[{"path":  "/path/to/workspace", "envManager": "ms-python.python:venv", "packageManager": "ms-python.python:pip"]}`. |
